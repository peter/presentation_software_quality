h1. TDD

"The simple fact that you are continually aligning your code to the tests results in code that is made up of small methods, each of which does one thing. These methods tend to be loosely coupled and have minimal side-effects."

"In effect, the tests act as a universal client for the entire code base, guiding all the code to have clean interactions between parts because the tests, acting as a third-party interloper, have to get in between all the parts of the code in order to work."
